Hi, I’m [Edi](https://github.com/eddbdea)! 

#### Building FormpipeAPI - an API that automates appointments by auto saving form data and injecting it in a Google Sheet that only the customer has access to. Beside that I am combining it with a boilerplate skeleton for a lead magnet website designed to capture leads, from copy to design.
