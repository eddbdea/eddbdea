- Hi, I’m [@eddbdea](https://github.com/eddbdea)  
- I'm interested in bringing ideas to life by turning them into real, usable products  
- Currently building a [Pastebin](https://github.com/eddbdea/Pastebin) project using:
  - Node.js and Express.js for the backend  
  - PostgreSQL for the database  
  - EJS and Bootstrap for the frontend
