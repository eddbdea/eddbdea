- Hi, I’m [@eddbdea](https://github.com/eddbdea)  
- Currently building [Pastebin](https://github.com/eddbdea/Presidential-elections) project to familiarise myself with the backend, using:
  - Node.js and Express.js for the backend  
  - PostgreSQL for the database  
  - EJS and Bootstrap for the frontend
